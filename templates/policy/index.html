  <h2>Privacy Policy & Terms of Use</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to all services, applications, and websites 
    operated under the <strong>Nyanthu</strong> brand, 
    including but not limited to <em>Thread</em>, <em>Tools</em>, <em>Net Game</em>, 
    and other software or web services published by Nyanthu.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>
    Nyanthu respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.  
    We do not collect personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or payment data 
    unless explicitly provided by the user (e.g., through voluntary email contact).
  </p>

  <p>
    Our websites and applications may use third-party services (including Cloudflare) 
    for hosting, security, or performance optimization.  
    These services may automatically set temporary or technical cookies — 
    for example, to distinguish human users from bots, protect against DDoS attacks, 
    or improve loading speed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such cookies are <strong>not</strong> used by Nyanthu for advertising, analytics, or personal tracking.  
    Any information processed by Cloudflare or similar providers is handled according to their respective privacy policies:
    <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you follow external links (e.g., GitHub, Amazon, or social media), 
    those sites are governed by their own privacy policies.  
    We recommend reviewing them before use.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Data Collection and Storage</h3>

  <p>
    Nyanthu’s apps and sites may collect limited technical data (such as device type, 
    browser version, or anonymized usage metrics) solely for the purpose of improving stability and performance.  
    This data is not linked to any individual user and is deleted or anonymized after analysis.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Terms of Use</h3>

  <p>
    The software, content, and materials provided by Nyanthu are intended for personal, 
    educational, and non-commercial use only.  
    Redistribution, modification, resale, or incorporation into other commercial products 
    without explicit permission is strictly prohibited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users are expected to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using Nyanthu’s services.  
    Any misuse, reverse engineering, or exploitation of vulnerabilities 
    for unauthorized purposes may result in termination of access.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Disclaimer</h3>

  <p>
    Nyanthu and its developers make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, 
    reliability, or availability of our services or materials.  
    We are not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages 
    resulting from the use or inability to use our software, websites, or applications.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Updates to This Policy</h3>

  <p>
    This policy may be updated periodically to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes.  
    The updated version will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date.  
    Continued use of Nyanthu’s services after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
